#This is a list of variables used in the Replace Role

#required variable:
#template_path - Path to template file to be used in Config Replace (Must be set by user)
#provider - to connect to nodes. This is set by ios/connect role so does not need to be defined by user

#optional variable:
#note - Adds a message to a text file in the output folder. Useful to note reason for change
#var_path - This is a path to an excel file with a sheet for host_vars/group_vars.
#This role will create the host_var and group_var folders and the excel file will  
#be converted into files which ansible can read. All current host_var/group_vars will be removed. 
#If this variable is not set then the default host_var and group_var folder will be used
#It is recommended the user sets this variable. See README.md for more detail
