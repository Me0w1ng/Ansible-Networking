#This role sets the variables for the NAPALM provider to ansible vars 
#so it will connect as long as ansible_user and ansible_password is set
#
#It also works for in-built IOS commands but not needed as the values are 
#automatically mapped by Ansible if no provider is given
#
#Will not work for NTC-Ansible. See NTC-Ansible doc to find out how to connect
provider:
  hostname: "{{ ansible_host }}"         #This is a parameter and is derived from your ansible inventory file
  host: "{{ ansible_host }}"             #Added for use with in-build IOS modules  
  username: '{{ ansible_user }}'         #The username to ssh with
  password: '{{ ansible_password }}'     #The line level password
  dev_os: 'ios'                          #The hardware operating system 
  
  platform: "cisco_ios"                  #NTC-Ansible specific variable
